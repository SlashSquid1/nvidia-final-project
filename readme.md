# AI Detection

 This project uses the NVIDIA Jetson Inference Library to create a AI Image Detection system. This model has been retrained to determine if an image is generated by AI or taken by a real human.

## Overview

This model classifies images as one of two categories: Real or Fake. Real images are photos taken by real people, while fake images are generated by AI.

## Why I Chose This Project

In 2025, the use of AI has increased significantly compared to past years. With greater usage, AI has also become more advanced, especially in the generative field, making it much more difficult to distinguish the difference. The group most widely affected are the elderly, as they have less exposure and knowledge of AI. To help counteract this issue, I've trained this AI model to detect the difference between real and fake images.

## The Dataset

[This folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QkXt5ZLUP-QBkR3w6nv-QdFveoJagZZv?usp=sharing) contains the model and the classification dataset. To set up and use them, please follow the guide below.

## Setup
### 1. Install Jetson Inference

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
cd jetson-inference
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
```

### 2. Prepare Dataset

Organize images like this:
```
jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data/AI/
├── train/
│   ├── fake/
│   ├── real/
├── val/
└── test/

```

### 3. Training

1. Enable more memory: `echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`
2. Train the model (I used batch size of 4)
  ```
  cd jetson-inference
  ./docker/run.sh
  cd python/training/classification
  python3 train.py --model-dir=models/AI data/archive
  ```
3. Export Model
  ```
  # Still in docker container:
  python3 onnx_export.py --model-dir=models/AI
  ```


## Running the Model

### Set Variables
```
cd jetson-inference/python/training/classification
NET=models/AI
DATASET=data/archive
```

### Test on Image
```
imagenet.py --model=$NET/resnet18.onnx --input_blob=input_0 --output_blob=output_0 --labels=$DATASET/labels.txt $DATASET/test/fake/<image.jpg> result.jpg
```
Replace <image.jpg> with your actual image.
