# AI Detection

 This project uses the NVIDIA Jetson Inference Library to create a AI Image Detection system. This model has been retrained to determine if an image is generated by AI or taken by a real human.

## Overview

This model classifies images as one of two categories: Real or Fake. Real images are photos taken by real people, while fake images are generated by AI.

## Why I Chose This Project

In 2025, the use of AI has increased significantly compared to past years. With greater usage, AI has also become more advanced, especially in the generative field, making it much more difficult to distinguish the difference. The group most widely affected are the elderly, as they have less exposure and knowledge of AI. To help counteract this issue, I've trained this AI model to detect the difference between real and fake images.
